1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Outcomes of Kickstarter campign success waries, based on several factors and we make following 
conclusions:
    -Generally most successful campaigns are launched during middle of the year around May and June.
    -Theater and Rock have avery good success rate, with Plays outpacing all other categories by far
     with a very good success rate in funding based on Category chart data. Although, "Film and Video"
    have best percentage success based on data chart.
    -Again "Plays" and "Film and Video" have a good succes rates based on Category Statistics and number
     of successfull campaigns. "Filmand & Video" Percentage wise have the very best success rate 
     compared just basedon "Category" Chart data.

Only limtiation of this data is that some Campaigns were canceled, even though they had 100% funding. 
Also, we are looking at the success of the campaign based only on one round Kickstarter funding. 
More campaigns, more chances of success.

We could try to correlate "Goal" amount to "success", "failed" and "canceled" rate to gain more 
visibility why some campaigns are more successful than others. 
It would be good to learn rate of return, and speed of return based on funding.
